# GTA Handling
### GTA Handling Config File Generator
I love the Grand Theft Auto series and I love modding the games even more. One popular starting point for modding is editing the [handling.cfg](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Handling.cfg) file found in the install/data directory. It's very tedious to do manually with the way the original files are written and the obscurity of some of the params that have spotty documentation. Editors were released to remedy this, but they were simple and didn't really address the obscurity problem.

At its core, the app spits out a valid handling.cfg file with which you can replace the original. But I'll be casually adding features to make the experience as informative and intuitive as possible.

## QuickStart:
1. Run ```npm i```
1. Run ```npm run start```

## Scripts:
Transpile and bundle: 
```
npm run build
```

Watch for file changes and bundle:
```
npm run watch
```

Start local app instance:
```
npm run start
```
